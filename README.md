# CustomImageChooser
This is a custom image chooser Android app that has a custom camera built using Camera2 API and a custom Image gallery.

1. In the custom gallery, I'm doing query for all images in the device. I'm populating all the Image folders in a RecyclerView  Grid layout. On selecting any folder, it loads another grid with all the images in that folder.

2. The custom camera, I have developed using Android's camera2 API. It has support for both front and back camera.
The images taken from this camera are saved inside the files folder of the app on the device.
